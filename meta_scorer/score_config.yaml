# --- Scoring Thresholds ---
thresholds:

  docking:
    # Docking affinity thresholds (lower = better)
    affinity:
      high: -9.0
      medium: -7.5
      low: -6.0
    rmsd_max: 3.0           # RMSD must be below this for full score
    min_poses: 3            # Minimum number of stable poses required

  adme_pk:
    logP_range: [0, 5]      # Acceptable lipophilicity range
    half_life_min: 2.0      # Minimum half-life in hours
    penalty_if_CYP_inhibited: 5  # Penalty if CYP inhibition is detected
    clearance_acceptable: ["acceptable"]  # Accepted clearance level

  toxicity:
    override_models: ["DILIrank", "ProTox-II"]  # Models that trigger immediate risk
    max_flags_allowed: 2                        # More than this = automatic no-go

  druggability:
    high_score: 0.7        # Score above this = high confidence
    mid_score: 0.5         # Minimum acceptable pocket score
    bonus_volume_min: 400  # Volume threshold for bonus
    bonus_hydrophobicity_min: 0.5  # Hydrophobicity bonus threshold
    volume_hydrophobicity_bonus: 2 # Bonus points for both

  drug_likeness:
    # Score assigned based on how many violations (e.g., Lipinski)
    score_by_violations:
      0: 10
      1: 5
      2: 0

  off_target:
    # Selectivity Index thresholds for scoring tiers
    si_thresholds: [2, 5, 10]     # >2 = low, >5 = mid, >10 = ideal
    low_target_bonus_threshold: 5 # If <5 off-targets â†’ bonus points
    low_target_bonus: 3           # Bonus points if off-targets are low
